The pseudosubarachnoid sign or pseudosubarachnoid haemorrhage sign is seen in patients with global anoxia. It is thought that the main reason for this sign is due to global loss of brain density secondary to hypoxia/anoxia. It can be differentiated from real subarachnoid haemorrhage due to the absence of high density in the cerebral sulci which is found with real subarachnoid haemorrhage.
