The bulging fissure sign is usually seen in the RUL in cases of lobar pneumonia, although not exclusively in this lobe. Thick exudative secretions lead to lobar expansion and result in bulging of the fissure. Other causes to consider are any 'space-occupying' lesion such as cancer, abscess or haematoma.
