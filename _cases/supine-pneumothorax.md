A pneumothorax locates in the apical region on an erect CXR. The lung edge is often seen along with absence of vascular markings over the pleural space.

On a supine CXR, a pneumothorax is more subtle and locates over the base of the chest producing the so-called 'deep sulcus sign'.  This video explains how to detect pneumothoraces on supine films.
