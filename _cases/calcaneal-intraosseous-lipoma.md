<p>Intraosseous lipomas are common incidental findings with 33% of them residing within the calcaneus. This is a classic case which can be diagnosed entirely from the plain film. It is the most common benign bone lesion of the calcaneus.</p>
<p>Features on plain radiography are</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Well circumscribed</li><li>Narrow zone of transition</li><li>Low density with some internal septations or calcifications</li><li>Normal surrounding bone clearly demarcated</li><li>No periosteal reaction</li><li>No soft tissue mass</li></ul><p>These are all features of a benign lesion.</p></p>
