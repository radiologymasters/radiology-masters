A blowout fracture is a fracture through the orbital floor usually caused by a punch injury to the eye.

It is best assessed using CT scans (more so than plain film) so that the in depth anatomy of the orbit can be assessed to ensure that there is not herniation of the inferior rectus muscle and entrapment.

In this video, the relevant injury anatomy, plain film and CT scans are assessed
