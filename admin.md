#### What can I do on the admin dashboard?

Authorised users are able to complete the following tasks once authenticated

* **Add new cases**<br>
The case authoring engine will take care of uploading and converting videos, creating cases in the database and publishing them live to [Radiology Masters](https://radiologymasters.com)

* **Update case**<br>
Everything including the video file can be updated and will be synchronised and re-published to all sources automatically.

* **Delete case**<br>
Cases cannot be recovered once removed and all user data associated with a case will also be erased. This will take care of removing the video, all database entries and publication on the website.
